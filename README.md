# Grazioso-Salvare-Animal-Shelter-Database

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable involves several key practices. In the context of the CRUD Python module from Project One, which was used to creat, read, update, and delete to the database in Project Two, these practices included modular design, descriptive naming, following coding standards, adding comments and documentation, writing unit tests, and refactoring. The advantages of working in this way include easier maintenance and debugging, improved readability for yourself and others, reusability of code in future projects, and scalability to accommodate future changes and requirements. The CRUD Python module could be used in the future for similar projects that require database functionality, saving time and effort in development.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
As a computer scientist, approaching a problem involves analyzing requirements, breaking down the problem into smaller, solvable components, designing a solution using appropriate algorithms and data structures, implementing the solution in code, testing to ensure correctness, and iterating to improve. In the context of the database and dashboard requirements for Grazioso Salvare, this approach likely involved understanding the data structure of the Austin Animal Center, designing database queries and dashboard widgets to display the data effectively, implementing the queries and widgets using PyMongo and Dash, testing the dashboard functionality, and refining the implementation based on feedback. This approach differs from previous assignments in other courses by focusing more on real-world data and client needs, requiring a more practical and applied approach to problem-solving. To create databases to meet other client requests in the future, I would use a similar approach, starting with a thorough understanding of the data and requirements, designing an appropriate database schema, implementing the database using a suitable technology, and testing to ensure the database meets the client's needs and is scalable and maintainable.


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists analyze problems, design algorithms to solve them efficiently, implement these algorithms in code, and evaluate and improve their solutions. Their work is essential for developing software, improving system performance, and advancing technology. Working on projects like the dashboard for Grazioso Salvare can help a company do their work better by providing tools to manage and analyze data more effectively, make informed decisions based on data-driven insights, and improve overall efficiency and productivity. In the case of Grazioso Salvare, the dashboard helps them identify and categorize dogs for search-and-rescue training more efficiently, ultimately improving their ability to save lives.
